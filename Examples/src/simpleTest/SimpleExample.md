# Simple Test
This example is quite simple, as it 
just uses KEquals and asserts a method exists.
You also don't need to assume that any files are in 
a different packages, further increasing the
simplicity. The ability to pass in "all" to the 
program is just for testing purposes while creating the tester.
For programs in intro to programming, 
this type of test is as complex as things will probably get.
